> Atom is really beautiful and great.
> One of my favorite features are snip-its. <br>
> For example if you are editing HTML and you type in the words html and press space it will replace it with all of this:
 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
```

#### User reviews
> NetBeans is used for development purposes in our organization by the IT department. At first, we used a different IDE for software development like Sublime Editor and Eclipse but I made a decision to use Netbeans as it is fast and has many features which a developer needs no matter which technology he/she is working on.
