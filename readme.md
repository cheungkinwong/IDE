### ATOM

#### Choosing the right IDE

#### Criteria
..* free
..* ease of use
..* light
..* customizable
..* languages

[My choice of IDE is **ATOM**](https://atom.io/)

#### PROS

1. extensibility _(packages  & themes)_
2. active community _(over 3500 packages)_
3. design & usability of the editor _(first time programmer could pick up Atom with ease)_

#### CON

1. Atom's startup time is noticeably slower than other text editors
2. once in awhile the editor freezes during usage
3. most of the core is written in coffeescript, but the team at Github is transitioning to ES6 (the modern edition of javascript)
