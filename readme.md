> Atom is great. It just works they way it supposed to work.
> _-Octocat-_ :octocat:


> Atom is really beautiful and great.
> One of my favorite features are snip-its. 
> For example if you are editing HTML and you type in the words html and press space it will replace it with all of this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
```


#### Conclusion

- [x] Is it Free?
- [x] Is it easy to use?
- [ ] Is it light? (fast)
- [x] Does it support a lot of languages?
