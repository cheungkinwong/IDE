> Atom is really beautiful and great.
> One of my favorite features are snip-its. <br>
> For example if you are editing HTML and you type in the words html and press space it will replace it with all of this:
 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
```

#### Conclusion

- [x] Is it **Free**?
- [x] Is it **easy** to use?
- [x] Is it **customizable**?
- [x] Does it support a lot of **languages**?

Atom's easy of use will allow me to be very productive while keeping frustration minimal. <br>
While it's customization options will ensure it won't be absolete in the near future.
